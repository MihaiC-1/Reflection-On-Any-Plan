# Reflection-On-Any-Plan

To create a reflection on any plan of any geometry form is the basic problem of create the reflaction of any dot on any plan.
So to create a reflection of a geometry form is to take every dot from that form and create the reflections for every dot.

This problem was made in IntelliJ IDEA in Java.
